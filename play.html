        PETRUCHIO
        Verona, for a while I take my leave,
        To see my friends in Padua, but of all
        My best beloved and approved friend,
        Hortensio; and I trow this is his house.
        Here, sirrah Grumio; knock, I say.
        GRUMIO
        Knock, sir! whom should I knock? is there man has
        rebused your worship?
        PETRUCHIO
        Villain, I say, knock me here soundly.
        GRUMIO
        Knock you here, sir! why, sir, what am I, sir, that
        I should knock you here, sir?
        PETRUCHIO
        Villain, I say, knock me at this gate
        And rap me well, or I'll knock your knave's pate.
        GRUMIO
        My master is grown quarrelsome. I should knock
        you first,
        And then I know after who comes by the worst.
        PETRUCHIO
        Will it not be?
        Faith, sirrah, an you'll not knock, I'll ring it;
        I'll try how you can sol, fa, and sing it.
        He wrings him by the ears

        GRUMIO
        Help, masters, help! my master is mad.
        PETRUCHIO
        Now, knock when I bid you, sirrah villain!
        Enter HORTENSIO
