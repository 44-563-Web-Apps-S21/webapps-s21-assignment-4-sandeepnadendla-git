        <h6>PETRUCHIO</h6>
        <p> Verona, for a while I take my leave,
            To see my friends in Padua, but of all
            My best beloved and approved friend,
            Hortensio; and I trow this is his house.
            Here, sirrah Grumio; knock, I say.</p>
        <h6>GRUMIO</h6>
        <p>Knock, sir! whom should I knock? is there man has
            rebused your worship?</p>
        <h6>PETRUCHIO</h6>
        <p>Villain, I say, knock me here soundly.</p>
        <h6>GRUMIO</h6>
        <p>Knock you here, sir! why, sir, what am I, sir, that
            I should knock you here, sir?</p>
        <h6>PETRUCHIO</h6>
        <p>Villain, I say, knock me at this gate
            And rap me well, or I'll knock your knave's pate.</p>

        <p> My master is grown quarrelsome. I should knock
            you first,
            And then I know after who comes by the worst.</p>

        <p>Will it not be?</p>
        <p>Faith, sirrah, an you'll not knock, I'll ring it;
            I'll try how you can sol, fa, and sing it.</p>
        <p>He wrings him by the ears</P>

        <h6>GRUMIO</h6>
